# Python library

How to build a Python library: how to organize it, how to design its API, how to
test it, and how to install and use it. We use `conecta_cuatro`, the package this
project ships, as the example.

## From a pile of scripts to a library

```mermaid

    S["📄 loose scripts"] --> O["📦 src/yourpackage/<br/>+ pyproject.toml"]
    O --> I["⬇️ pip install"]
    I --> U["🧪 tests · 🌐 web · 🏆 tournament"]
```

What that step buys: any part of the project — and anyone outside it — can write
`import yourpackage` and have all of it.

!!! tip "See the result"
    Every technique on these pages is applied in this repository. The
    [The game](../../game/index.md) section is the result: the reference manual
    of `conecta_cuatro`, with API blocks generated from the very docstrings this
    section teaches you to write.
