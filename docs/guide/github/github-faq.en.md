# FAQ

Common questions about GitHub and the collaborative workflow. Each answer links
to the page where the topic is covered in full.

??? question "What is the difference between Git and GitHub?"
    **Git** is the version-control tool that runs on your computer; **GitHub** is
    a website that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration features (pull
    requests, issues, Actions, Pages). You can use Git with no GitHub; GitHub
    always uses Git underneath. See [What is GitHub](github.md#git-is-not-github).

??? question "Do I have to pay to use GitHub?"
    No. A free account covers everything in this guide: public *and* private
    repositories, unlimited collaborators, GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. Paid
    plans add higher limits and organization features you will not need here.

??? question "When do I create a branch and when do I fork?"
    If you have write access to the repository (your own or your team's), create
    a **branch**. If you do not (someone else's public repository), **fork** it —
    make your own copy — then open a pull request back to the original. See
    [Pull requests § Branch PR or fork PR](pull-requests.md#branch-pr-or-fork-pr).

??? question "What is a pull request, exactly?"
    A proposal to merge one branch into another, with a diff, a description and a
    discussion attached. It is where review and the automated checks happen
    before code reaches `main`. See [Pull requests](pull-requests.md).

??? question "What is the difference between an issue and a pull request?"
    An **issue** describes something to do or fix — it is a conversation, no code.
    A **pull request** proposes an actual change and carries a diff. A PR can say
    `Closes #12` to auto-close the issue it resolves when merged. See
    [First steps § Issues and pull requests](first-steps.md#issues-and-pull-requests).

??? question "Git asks for a password when I push, but my GitHub password is rejected. Why?"
    GitHub stopped accepting account passwords for Git operations. Push over
    HTTPS with a **Personal Access Token** in place of the password, or set up an
    **SSH key**. See [First steps § Create an account](first-steps.md#create-an-account).

??? question "What does the green `Verified` badge on a commit mean?"
    That the commit was **cryptographically signed** with a key GitHub associates
    with the author, so its authorship can be trusted. Configure it with GPG or
    SSH signing. See [Workflow § Commit signing](workflow.md#commit-signing).

??? question "What are GitHub Actions?"
    Automation that runs on GitHub's servers when an event happens (a push, a pull
    request, a schedule). This repository uses them to lint, type-check and test
    on three Python versions, to build the documentation, to run the weekly
    tournament and to deploy the web app. See [GitHub Actions](actions.md).

??? question "A check on my pull request is red. What do I do?"
    Open the failing check in the **Actions** tab and read its log — it names
    exactly what failed. Every check is a command you can run locally
    (`ruff check .`, `mypy`, `pytest -q`, `mkdocs build --strict`); fix the
    problem, push again, and the check re-runs. See
    [GitHub Actions § Reading a failed run](actions.md#reading-a-failed-run).

??? question "Why can't I push directly to `main`?"
    Because the repository has a **ruleset** protecting it: changes must go
    through a reviewed pull request. This is deliberate — it keeps `main` from
    breaking. See [Repository configuration](repository-configuration.md).

??? question "My check says 'Expected' and never runs, so I cannot merge. Why?"
    A workflow marked as a **required** status check but filtered by `paths:` will
    not run on a pull request that touches none of those paths — and a required
    check that never arrives blocks the merge forever. Remove the filter from the
    `pull_request` trigger. See
    [GitHub Actions § Building the documentation](actions.md#building-the-documentation).

??? question "How is the playable page published?"
    A workflow bundles the Python into `web/py.zip`, uploads the whole `web/`
    folder as a Pages artifact and deploys it, so **GitHub Pages** serves it at
    `https://grabifv.github.io/CONECTA_CUATRO/`. See [GitHub Pages](pages.md).

??? question "And how is this documentation site published?"
    Not by Pages — by **Read the Docs**, which builds the MkDocs site from
    `.readthedocs.yaml` on every push. See
    [Read the Docs](../documentation/readthedocs.md).

??? question "I opened a pull request but nothing was deployed. Why?"
    A pull request **from a fork** runs with a read-only token and no secrets, so
    it cannot publish anything. The tests and the documentation build still run;
    there is just no deployment. See
    [GitHub Pages § Pull requests cannot deploy](pages.md#pull-requests-cannot-deploy).

??? question "The weekly tournament stopped running by itself. What happened?"
    GitHub disables `schedule:` triggers in a repository with no activity for 60
    days. Re-enable the workflow from the Actions tab. See
    [Repository configuration](repository-configuration.md).
