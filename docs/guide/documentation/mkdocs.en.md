# MkDocs

**MkDocs** turns a folder of Markdown files into a static website. You write
`docs/*.md`, describe the navigation in `mkdocs.yml`, and one command produces a
`site/` directory of HTML you can host anywhere.

This site is a MkDocs project, so every example on this page is real.

---

## The two commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"    # the docs extra of this project

mkdocs serve                # live-reloading preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000
mkdocs build --strict       # produce site/, and fail on any warning
```

`mkdocs serve` rebuilds and refreshes the browser as you save. Keep it running
while you write.

`mkdocs build --strict` is what CI runs. Without `--strict`, a broken internal
link is a warning printed into a log nobody reads; with it, the build fails and
the pull request goes red. Use it locally before pushing.

---

## `mkdocs.yml`

One file configures everything. The blocks, in the order you will care about
them:

### Identity

```yaml
site_name: Conecta Cuatro Arena
site_description: >-
  Conecta Cuatro Arena — the reference manual of the project and the guide to building
  one of your own…
site_url: https://conecta-cuatro.readthedocs.io
repo_url: https://github.com/grabifv/CONECTA_CUATRO
repo_name: grabifv/CONECTA_CUATRO
edit_uri: edit/main/docs/
```

`repo_url` puts a link to the repository in the header; `edit_uri` adds an "edit
this page" pencil on every page that opens the right file on GitHub. Two lines,
and the barrier to fixing a typo drops to nearly zero.

### Theme

```yaml
theme:
  name: material
  palette:
    - media: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
      scheme: slate
      primary: teal
      toggle: { icon: material/weather-sunny, name: Switch to light mode }
    - media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)"
      scheme: default
      primary: teal
      toggle: { icon: material/weather-night, name: Switch to dark mode }
  features:
    - content.code.copy
    - navigation.indexes
    - navigation.footer
    - navigation.top
    - navigation.tracking
    - search.highlight
    - toc.follow
```

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is the theme
almost everyone uses. It brings search, a light/dark toggle, responsive
navigation, copy buttons on code blocks, and the admonition and card styles this
guide relies on.

### Navigation

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - The game:
      - game/index.md
      - Game rules: game/rules.md
      - Upload a new bot:
          - game/upload-a-bot/index.md
          - 1. Player API: game/upload-a-bot/player-api.md
  - Guide:
      - guide/index.md
      - Step-by-step guide: guide/step-by-step.md
      - Git:
          - guide/git/index.md
          - 1. What is Git: guide/git/git.md
```

The `nav` tree is the sidebar, in order. Three conventions worth copying:

- **Split the site into top-level parts that answer different questions.** This
  one has two — *The game* documents what the project does, *Guide* teaches how
  to build one — and no page belongs to both. Nest further when a part has two
  audiences: *The game* splits into *Upload a new bot* and *Advanced
  documentation*.
- A bare path as the **first** entry of a section (`game/index.md`) makes that
  page the section's landing page instead of a separate entry. Pair it with the
  `navigation.indexes` theme feature so the section title itself is clickable.
- Numbering the titles (`1. What is Git`) tells a reader there is an intended
  order, which a plain list does not.

A page that exists in `docs/` but is missing from `nav` is a warning — and with
`--strict`, a failure. That is a feature: it catches the page you wrote and
forgot to link.

### Markdown extensions

Plain Markdown is not enough for technical writing. These are the ones this site
enables and why:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - admonition
  - attr_list
  - md_in_html
  - pymdownx.details
  - pymdownx.emoji: { ... }
  - pymdownx.superfences:
      custom_fences:
        - name: mermaid
          class: mermaid
          format: !!python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format
  - pymdownx.tabbed: { alternate_style: true }
  - pymdownx.highlight: { anchor_linenums: true }
  - pymdownx.inlinehilite
  - tables
  - toc: { permalink: true }
```

| Extension | Gives you |
| --- | --- |
| `admonition` + `pymdownx.details` | `!!! tip` boxes, and collapsible `???` ones |
| `attr_list` + `md_in_html` | Material's `grid cards` blocks |
| `pymdownx.superfences` + `custom_fences` | mermaid diagrams instead of printed diagram source |
| `pymdownx.tabbed` | `=== "Tab"` content tabs |
| `toc: permalink` | the ¶ anchor beside every heading |

An admonition is four spaces of indentation under a marker line:

```markdown
!!! warning "Timing is measured in CI"
    GitHub's runners are slower than a laptop.

??? question "Is this collapsible?"
    Yes — `???` starts collapsed, `???+` starts open.
```

And a diagram is a fenced block:

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Write Markdown] --> B[mkdocs build]
    B --> C[site/]
```
````

!!! danger "The card grid fails silently"
    Material's `<div class="grid cards" markdown>` needs **both** `attr_list` and
    `md_in_html`. Without them MkDocs emits a raw `<div>` wrapping unprocessed
    Markdown, reports **no warning**, and `mkdocs build --strict` stays green
    while the page is visibly broken. If a card grid renders as a bullet list of
    literal text, that is the cause.

---

## API pages from docstrings

Writing a reference by hand guarantees it goes stale.
[mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) generates it from the source
instead:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocstrings:
      handlers:
        python:
          paths: [src]
          options:
            show_source: true
            show_root_heading: true
            docstring_style: google
```

Then a single directive in any page renders an object's signature, type hints,
argument table and a link to the source lines:

```markdown
::: conecta_cuatro.player.Player
```

`docstring_style: google` is what parses `Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:` blocks
into tables. Pick a style, declare it once, and write every docstring that way —
see [API](../python-library/api.md).

---

## Extra CSS

`extra_css` loads your own stylesheet last, so you can override the theme:

```yaml
extra_css:
  - stylesheets/extra.css
```

This project uses it for two things: giving mermaid diagrams enough contrast in
both light and dark mode, and widening the content column so the workflow YAML
blocks are not cramped. Keep it small — every rule you add is one the theme's
next version can fight with.

---

## Two languages from one tree

This site publishes in Spanish and English from a single `docs/` folder, using
[mkdocs-static-i18n](https://ultrabug.github.io/mkdocs-static-i18n/). **You do
not need this for your project** — one language is a perfectly good answer — but
if you want two, this is how.

The convention is a **filename suffix**: the default language keeps the
unsuffixed file, and each extra language adds its own.

| File | Language |
|---|---|
| `rules.md` | Spanish (the default language) |
| `rules.en.md` | English |

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - i18n:
      docs_structure: suffix
      fallback_to_default: true
      languages:
        - locale: es
          name: Español
          default: true
          build: true
        - locale: en
          name: English
          build: true
          nav_translations:
            Reglas del juego: Game rules
```

Three things worth knowing before you start:

- The `nav` is declared **once**, with the unsuffixed paths, and
  `nav_translations` translates the sidebar titles.
- `fallback_to_default: true` serves the default-language page when the
  translation does not exist yet, so a half-translated site still builds.
- Changing the default language **forces you to rename every file**, so pick it
  at the start.

!!! tip "Generated reference pages stay in English"
    A page whose body comes from docstrings renders the same text in every
    language. Translate the prose around it and say so in a short note, instead
    of pretending the reference is bilingual.
