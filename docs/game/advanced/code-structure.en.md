# Code structure

The repository has **six places to look**. Everything else hangs off them.

## Inside the package

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `game.py` | the pure rules: `legal_moves`, `apply_move`, `is_terminal`, `winner`, `is_draw` |
| `player.py` | the abstract `Player` class — [the API other people implement](../upload-a-bot/player-api.md) |
| `registry.py` | in-memory catalogue, name → `Player` |
| `manifest.py` | loads the `players.yaml` manifests into the registry |
| `tournament.py` | formats, timing and results |
| `elo.py` | per-game Elo rating |
| `cli.py` | the terminal game (`conecta-cuatro`) and its local leaderboard |
| `bots/` | generic negamax with alpha-beta pruning, and the two heuristics `medium` and `hard` use |

## Four design decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **`apply_move` returns a new state** and never mutates its input | minimax explores many hypothetical futures; shared mutable state would be a subtle source of bugs |
| **State is a plain list of ints** | the same value crosses Python → JS → Python (Pyodide) with no custom serialization |
| **Timing lives in the tournament**, not in the player or the game | the contract an outsider implements stays tiny; timing is a property of the *game* |
| **Discovery is an explicit manifest**, not a folder scan | the trust boundary is visible in a single diff, and a stranger's code is not run just to be discovered |

source.
