"""Reusable strategy implementations that the shipped players are built from.

These are **public API**: a submitted player is free to import one and configure
or subclass it. Writing a bot from scratch is the real exercise, but starting from
a working search — and beating it by improving only the heuristic — is a
legitimate and instructive first submission.

The split throughout this package is between *searching* and *knowing*:

* :class:`~conecta_cuatro.bots.minimax.MinimaxBot` searches. It holds no Connect Four knowledge
  whatsoever, only negamax with alpha-beta plus one hook.
* :class:`~conecta_cuatro.bots.basic_minimax.BasicMinimaxBot` and
  :class:`~conecta_cuatro.bots.smart_minimax.SmartMinimaxBot` know things. They override
  the hook and add nothing to the search.

The players in ``players/`` add only *identity* — a name, authors, a description
and a depth. See ``players/builtin/hard.py`` for the shortest complete example.
