"""A tiny, self-contained Elo rating implementation.

Elo is used by the **league** tournament format (see :mod:`conecta_cuatro.tournament`)
to rank players by a rating that reflects *who* they beat, not just how many
games they won. Ratings are updated **one game at a time**, in play order, so the
result is order-dependent — the tournament always feeds games in a deterministic
order, keeping the ratings reproducible.

Connect Four can end in a draw when the board fills up: a draw scores ``0.5``
for both players, a win ``1.0`` and a loss ``0.0``.
